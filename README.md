# Class project for L310 Introduction to Robotics

## Project Description
Two teams of robots (police and baddies) are tasked with different objectives in a common workspace. The police know the live location of the baddies and need to get to a certain distance of a baddie robot to consider it caught, ignoring it from there onwards. The baddies have the advantage of improved speed and must stay clear of the police for as long as possible. Show how the capture behaviour changes according to the difference in speed between teams and the ‘liveness’ of the observations, and propose strategies to deal with these.
